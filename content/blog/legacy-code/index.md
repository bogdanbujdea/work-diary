Q: What's the easiest way to get past imposters syndrome?

A: Start working on some legacy code!

Why? Because we always have the feeling that we could have done a lot better when we're reading legacy code.
Even if it's our own code.

Yesterday I got the approval to refactor an old piece of code. Naturally I got very excited and even
promised the client it would take only a few hours to do it. Fast forward 24 hours and it's still not done.
It was easy for me to assume that the previous developers wrote that shitty code because they were bad at writing code.
Turns out, the platform has some limitations too and ultimately it was possible with some "hacks".

The point is that although it was possible to fix that code, I should have first analyzed it and try to
understand why it was written that way. In the worst case scenario I would have promised to make an
improvement that wasn't possible, lucky for me I could do it but with a significant delay.
