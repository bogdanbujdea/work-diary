I'm starting a new project today...a public work diary. I learn new things
everyday and I always think they are too short for a blog post, so I'll
be using this Gatsby site to publish short stories of things that I learn at work.
Of course, my job requires that I keep my work confidential so I'll just share
generic stuff, without disclosing projects or customers.
